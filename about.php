Students will be able to offer their used books for sale at their own prices. Students wishing to buy used books will be able to search the listings for the desired book and order it from any seller that is offering the book. The seller and the buyer will agree on the payment and book delivery method. It will be possible for the buyer and the seller to just meet up on the campus and pay in cash.
